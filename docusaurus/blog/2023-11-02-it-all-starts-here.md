## Hello everyone!

My name is Grigory x1kk4 Valevin, I am a frontend developer.
For my work and learning, I everyday use VS Code. I think this took is very good because of its lightness, portably and customization possibilities. One of the key features, without which I cannot imagine a modern code editor, is the configuration of user snippets. I made a preset of snippets that I use myself and posted them on GitHub so as not to lose them. However, now technologies are changing too fast, and the stack is selected for the needs of the project, and therefore there is a need to add new syntactic constructions that I am tired of describing by hand in a JSON file.

##### Therefore, I am motivated to create a set of utilities that will help me keep my snippet pack up to date.
